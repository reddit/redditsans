Desktop fonts
-------------
Desktop fonts can be found in "fonts/desktop".

Web fonts
-------------
Web fonts are available in two varieties, full and subset.
The full webfonts contain all features and are found in "fonts/web/full".

The subset webfonts are split into six unicode ranges to provide the smallest
footprint. Most English-language users are covered by the basic glyphs in the
ASCII range, and will only need the first set (A). Extended Latin and other
miscellaneous characters are provided in the supplementary fonts. Not each
range covers the same number of code points, and not every code point has a
corresponding glyph. Future versions of the fonts may contain more glyphs, but
are unlikely to require changes to the unicode range listed below. These fonts
are found in "fonts/web/subset" and are grouped by folder.

A: U+0020-00BF
B: U+00C0-00FF
C: U+0100-01FF
D: U+0200-0FFF
E: U+1000-1FFF
F: U+2000-FFFF

CSS files are provided for both full and subset fonts.

Variant fonts
-------------
Desktop and web fonts are exported for each flavor – Vanilla, Chocolate, 
Strawberry and Fudge. They can be found in "fonts/desktop/variants" and
"fonts/web/variants". These are useful in contexts that don't support
stylistic alternatives. Note there is no italic variant for Strawberry.

A CSS file is provided for web versions of variant fonts.
