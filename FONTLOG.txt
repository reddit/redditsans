FONTLOG for the Reddit Sans fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Reddit Sans Font Software. This
information should be distributed along with the Reddit Sans fonts and any
derivative works.

Basic Font Information

The typeface of the Internet, Reddit Sans is a sans serif family available in 5 weights with true italics. Reddit Sans letterforms were chosen for legibility and distinctiveness, pairing humanist characteristics with a geometric base. Humanist sans-serif typefaces have roots in hand-drawn lettering, giving them warmth and personality, while geometric typefaces focus on practicality and simplicity, making them ideal for information delivery.

Reddit Sans has clear, understandable letterforms which maintain some of the warm eclectic nature of online discourse. It’s designed to be incredibly versatile with a large x-height for readability, and disambiguated letterforms for rapid identification. The slash, such a key part of the internet's syntax, is foundational to the design of Reddit Sans. In Reddit Sans, the slash's 67.5º angle is repeated throughout the letterforms, giving them a distinct, contemporary appearance.

We connect people of all ages and abilities, so special attention was paid to accessibility features of Reddit Sans. In particular, we chose a large x-height to make characters easily legible even at small sizes, and included rounded bowls to make characters like o, p, d, and p easily recognizable when scanning text. To aid character recognition further for people with dyslexia, we made sure to disambiguate characters that can be easily confused, such as capital 'I' and lowercase 'l' as well as ensuring that characters like 'b' and 'd' or 'u' and 'n' are not simply rotated or flipped variations of one another. Dots on characters like 'I' and 'j' are fully round, helping differentiate them from the uppercase. And Reddit Sans' unique 'r' shape ensures that the 'rn' pairing is not easily mistaken for an 'm'.

The fonts include more than 1,000 glyphs. This character set includes support for the Google Fonts Latin Core, Latin Plus, Latin Pro and Latin Expert glyph sets, excluding the small capitals and discretionary ligatures from the Expert set. It also contains a small number of additional glyphs and stylistic sets. The range covers Western and Central European language, Vietnamese, currencies, alternate numerals, math symbols and units of measure, Latin general use extensions, superiors and inferiors, spacing modifiers, typographic spaces, additional punctuation (with case alternates), numerators and denominators, fractions, arrows and geometric shapes. Reddit Sans includes support for over 100 languages.
